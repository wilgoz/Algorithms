# Algorithms

A small compilation of algorithms, implemented in various languages just for the fun of it

## Compression

- Huffman Coding (C++) [TODO]

## Data Structures

- Naive Binary Search Tree (C++ / Go)
- Max Heap (C++)

## Sorting Algorithms

- Countsort (C)
- Sleepsort (C)

## Graph Algorithms

### Graph Search

- Dijkstra's Algorithm (C++)
  > Requires libboost to be installed
- A\* (C++) [TODO]

### Minimum Spanning Trees

- Kruskal & Prim's Algorithm (Java)
  > Benchmarks the performances on sparse & dense graphs
